# Forecasting Nutrition Crises Using Climate, Conflict, and Market Data â€“ South Sudan

This repository contains the code, figures, and supporting materials for a masterâ€™s dissertation submitted to the University of East London (October 2025).  
The project explores the use of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict nutrition crises in South Sudan based on climate, conflict, and market indicators.

## Overview
The goal of this study was to test whether data-driven models can identify early signals of nutrition crises.  
Results showed moderate predictive performance, with Logistic Regression offering better balance and interpretability than Random Forest.  
The study highlights the potential of predictive analytics in humanitarian early warning systems, while emphasizing the need for improved data quality and richer feature sets.
